                        <p>
                            The mention of a root canal often conjures up images of pain and discomfort. However, at Kalra Dental Care, we’re changing this narrative. A root canal is a treatment to save and restore a tooth that is badly decayed or infected. The procedure involves removing the pulp inside the tooth, cleaning, disinfecting, and then filling and sealing it. The reality is, root canal treatments are pain-relievers, not pain-bringers.
